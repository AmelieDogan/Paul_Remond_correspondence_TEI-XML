# Encoding the Correspondence of Paul Rémond with TEI-XML

This repository contains the TEI customization and encoded corpus of the correspondence of Paul Rémond, Bishop of Nice (1930–1963). The project aims to preserve the cultural and historical value of his letters while enabling scholarly analysis and digital access.

## Historical Context

Paul Rémond was a key religious and cultural figure of the 20th century. Ordained in 1899, he rose to prominence as a preacher and as the highest-ranking cleric in the French army during World War I. In 1930, he became Bishop of Nice, where he served until his death in 1963. A republican and patriotic leader, Rémond condemned Nazi anti-Semitism as early as 1933 and later supported the Resistance, helping save 527 Jewish children through a network he established. His correspondence reflects his spiritual reflections, decisions as a religious authority, and interactions with institutions of the time, offering a rich account of his actions and the historical context.

## TEI Encoding and Customization

The project leverages the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standard to ensure precise, extensible encoding of the letters. Key features include:
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: `<teiHeader>` elements record provenance, authorship, and publication details.
- **Structural Clarity**: Letters are organized using `<div>`, `<opener>`, and `<closer>` tags.
- **Named Entity Indexing**: People, places, and organizations are indexed in the `<back>` section for cross-referencing.

The customization ensures historical accuracy while supporting future reuse for research, education, and digital archiving.
