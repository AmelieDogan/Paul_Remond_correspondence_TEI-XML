# Encoding the correspondence of Paul Rémond with TEI-XML

The project is based on the **study and organization of the correspondence of Paul Rémond**, Bishop of Nice from 1930 to 1963.

Ordained a priest in 1899 in Besançon, Paul Rémond quickly embarked on a brilliant ecclesiastical career, notably as a preacher. Drafted during World War I, he ended the war as the highest-ranking cleric in the French army. In 1921, he was consecrated a bishop to oversee the newly established chaplaincy of the Army of the Rhine, created by the government to help improve acceptance of the occupation among German Catholic populations.

In 1930, at the end of the Occupation, Paul Rémond accepted the See of Nice, where he remained until his death. He was a republican and patriotic bishop. He organized triumphalist religious celebrations that attracted tens of thousands of people. He developed Catholic Action, unionism, and clergy training.

He condemned Nazi anti-Semitism as early as April 1933. Appalled by the Italian and German occupations as well as by collaboration and state anti-Semitism, he devoted himself to supporting the Resistance. With a Jewish friend, he established a network at the bishopric that hid and saved 527 Jewish children. His funeral, on April 27, 1963, in central Nice, was a grand ceremony that made his popularity and prestige evident.

His correspondence provides a **rich and varied account of his actions**. Through his writings, we gain insight into his spiritual reflections, his decisions as a religious authority, and his interactions with other institutions of the time, making it a valuable source for understanding the historical and ecclesiastical context of this period.

Using **XML** to structure these data allows for **maximizing their value by creating a structured, coherent, and searchable format**. With XML, each letter can be tagged by author, recipient, date, subject, and place, thus facilitating access to specific information within this vast corpus. For instance, it is possible to index correspondences dealing with humanitarian topics or administrative measures concerning his diocese, enabling rapid thematic or statistical analysis of the bishop's various concerns.
